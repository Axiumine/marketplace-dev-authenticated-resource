 * ADR-044. Suspension is the operator's instrument end to end: the Admin tier raises it, and the Admin
 * tier is the only hand that lifts it — *"if admin suspend an account, admin must remove the suspension
 * for allow the shopowner to log in again"*. A ShopOwner-tier service able to write any `disabled*`
 * field could clear a sanction standing against the very account making the request, which is the same
 * argument `APPROVAL_GATE_FIELD_SHOP_OWNER` makes for `waitApprov`, and it earns the same lock.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A write ban, not a ban.** Reading the flag is what `checkUserAuthorizationDisDel` does at login
 * and `findAccountForSession` does on every refresh, and those two reads are the enforcement — a rule
 * refusing them would refuse the gate. Hence four write shapes and no read shape: the object-literal key
 * a `$set` is built from, the same key written as a string, and both assignment forms
 * (`owner.disabled = false`, `owner['disabled'] = false`), which is the shape the E12-S04 audit actually
 * found for `rejectUnauthorized` and which a `Property`-only rule passes.
 *
 * `ObjectExpression >` rather than a bare `Property`, because an `ObjectPattern` is a `Property` too and
 * destructuring the flag off a document that was just read is a read. The collateral this accepts is the
 * object form of a Mongoose projection — `.select({ disabled: 1 })` is indistinguishable from a `$set`
 * at this level and is refused with it. Nothing here uses that form: every projection on the platform is
 * the space-separated string, which no selector below touches.
 *
 * The three names are `shopOwner`'s real ones, from `BEs/marketplace-db-setup/lib/schemas/account.js`.
 * There is no `disabledAt` — ADR-044 names one in prose as a shape it would also cover, and the schema
 * never grew it, so banning the name would be banning nothing.
 *
 * Scoped to `src/**` where it is used below: a test proving a suspended owner is refused has to seed
 * `disabled: true`, and a fixture is an object literal like any other.

	// the time a request reaches this service its session has already been through that gate, so a
